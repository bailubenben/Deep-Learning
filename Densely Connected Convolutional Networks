1.what is DenseNets?
  Dense Convo-lutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas
traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections—one between each layer and its subsequent layer—our network has L(L+1)
direct connections. For2
ach layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are
used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs
into all subsequent layers.
