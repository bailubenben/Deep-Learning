1.what is DenseNets?
  Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. Whereas
traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections—one between each layer and its subsequent layer—
our network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are
used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers.

2.advantages
1)alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem
2)strengthen feature propagation
3)encourage feature reuse
4)substantially reduce the number of parameters
